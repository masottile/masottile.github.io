I am a fourth year engineering student at UBC with prior experience in mechanical design, data analysis, and software development.

## Projects
With some of my classmates, I built a fully autonomous robot, [Han Yolo](https://hanyolo-shootsfirst.github.io/). I still remember the day I messed up a parameter by a factor of 10 and sent our robot full speed, backwards off a table; I was so thankful it survived.

## Activities
Outside of courses, you can find me running [EUS Tutoring](https://ubcengineers.ca/tutoring) sessions for the Engineering Undergraduate Society.

## Art
When I get extra board, I like to paint things or get a little creative with my baking. I surprised some of my high school classmates by going into engineering instead of dropping out to sell art full time.
